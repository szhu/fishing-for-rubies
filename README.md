==================

This is a smart, fast fish-shell integration for RVM.

## Features

 - The slow RVM script runs only when necessary.
 - Control whether each directory should have RVM auto-loaded. Auto-load is off by default
 - Helpful messages inform you about how to activate RVM or change auto-load settings.
